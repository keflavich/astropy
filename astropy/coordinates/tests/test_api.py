# notes from the original api document:
'''
The emphasis of this package is that common tasks should
be performed in as simple and intuitive manner as possible.
Complex or unusual tasks are still possible, but should not
interfere with the simplicity of common tasks.

One design principle is that objects should silently accept parameters
of any data type that can unambiguously be determined. Where data types
are accepted, they should be specified as constants, not as strings.
If an unknown unit is specified as a string, the code certainly
cannot handle it.

A note on units: Units (as with everything else in Python) are objects.
Any instance of a "unit" keyword will only accept "Unit" objects, not
bare strings. All commonly used units will be predefined in astropy.units
(which is still under development). The exact syntax might change,
but the ideas will not. Units may be specified as part of a string in
an initializer (subscribing to the "accept and parse values that are
unambiguous to a human reader" philosophy), but will not be accepted as
a bare string anywhere else.

On arrays: The interface outlined here only accepts scalar angles (and hence
coordinates) - we will likely later expand it to allow arrays to be stored in
these objects, but only after the scalar interfaces is complete and working.
