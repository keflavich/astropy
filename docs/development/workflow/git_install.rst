There are several ways to install git on Mac. The easiest is to simply download the OS X installer (git-osx-installer_). If you have MacPorts installed, you can also do::

    sudo port install git-core
    
If you have Fink installed, you can do::

    sudo apt-get install git

In addition, you may want to use a GUI to manage your git repositories. A good example of a free GUI is `GitX <https://github.com/brotherbard/gitx>`_.
