Contributing To/Developing Astropy or Affiliated Packages
=========================================================

Summary
-------

As described in :ref:`vision`, development of components intended for
inclusion in the core ``astropy`` package will initially be done by different
teams via *affiliated packages*. These affiliated packages will then be
submitted for inclusion in the ``astropy`` core package by creating a git fork
of the core repository, merging the new component into the fork, and
submitting the package as a pull request. The step of creating a fork and
merging the affiliated package into the fork can be done either by the team
contributing the affiliated package, or by the coordination committee if
requested.

Once an affiliated package has been accepted and integrated as a component
into the core ``astropy`` package, subsequent improvements and bug fixes can
be made in the same way by forking the core repository and submitting a pull
request.

The bottom line is that teams working on various components are free to choose
the version control system and workflow that they want, but ultimately the
changes need to be merged into a fork of the core repository and submitted via
a pull request to the core repository, either by the team or by the
coordination committee.

For the Impatient
-----------------

The only absolutely necessary configuration step is identifying yourself and your contact info::

     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com

More detailed information and instructions are below.

After that, if you then just want to get the latest ``astropy`` source code, cd to a directory on your computer you want to put the source code, and do::

     git clone git@github.com:astropy/astropy.git

You will then have a new copy of the source code in the ``astropy`` directory.

Later, if you want to update to the most recent version of the ``astropy`` code, just go do::

   cd astropy
   git pull

If you find a bug and want to fix it, see :ref:`basic-workflow` or :ref:`advanced-workflow` depending on how comfortable you are with git.

Git Documentation
-----------------

The following sections cover the installation of the git software, the basic configuration, and links to resources to learn more about using git. However, you can also directly go to the `GitHub help pages <http://help.github.com/>`_ which offer a great introduction to git and GitHub.

Workflow
--------

The following two sections describe the workflow for the ``astropy`` core
package, but teams working on affiliated packages that have chosen to use git
are encouraged to also follow these guidelines internally.
