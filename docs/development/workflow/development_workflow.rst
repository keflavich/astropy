This document describes how to contribute to a git repository hosted on
GitHub. The example shown here is that of the core ``astropy`` repository, but
the workflow can work equally well for the internal development of an
affiliated package.

Before following the instructions on this page, make sure you have correctly
installed and configured git:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   git_install
   git_configure

The following documents describe a beginner and advanced workflow for
contributing respectively:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   development_workflow_basic.rst
   development_workflow_advanced.rst

.. include:: links.inc
